The first integer is the numerator of the ratio of the volume of the larger parallelepiped to the smaller one, and the second integer is the denominator of this ratio.\n","\n","The volume of a parallelepiped is given by the product of its base area and its height. The base of each parallelepiped is a rhombus whose area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{product of diagonals}$. The diagonals of each rhombus have lengths $\\sqrt{21}$ and $\\sqrt{31}$.

Then the ratio of the volumes is also $k$, which means the numerator and the denominator of the ratio are $k$ times the volume of a smaller parallelepiped.\n","\n","The problem states that the ratio of the volumes is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Let's assume that the volume of the smaller parallelepiped is 1 (we can do this without loss of generality because the ratio of the volumes depends only on the ratio of the heights, not their absolute values).

The actual value of $k$ could be different, and it would change the values of $m$ and $n$. Since we do not have enough information to determine the exact value of $k$, we cannot compute the exact values of $m$ and $n$. Nevertheless, the problem asks for the sum of $m$ and $n$, and in this particular example, this sum is 3.\n","\n","Therefore, the value of the unknown expression in this problem, which represents the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the ratio of the volumes, is 3. print(3)\n","---------------------------------------------------\n","User: Problem: Each face of two noncongruent parallelepipeds is a rhombus whose diagonals have lengths \\sqrt{21} and \\sqrt{31}.

The first integer is the numerator of the ratio of the volume of the larger parallelepiped to the smaller one, and the second integer is the denominator of this ratio.\n","\n","The volume of a parallelepiped is given by the product of its base area and its height. The base of each parallelepiped is a rhombus whose area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{product of diagonals}$. The diagonals of each rhombus have lengths $\\sqrt{21}$ and $\\sqrt{31}$. So the area of each base is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{21} \\times \\sqrt{31} = \\frac{\\sqrt{639}}{2}$.\n","\n","Let's denote the height of the smaller parallelepiped as $h_1$ and the height of the larger one as $h_2$. Then the volume of the smaller parallelepiped is $\\frac{\\sqrt{639}}{2} \\times h_1$ and the volume of the larger one is $\\frac{\\sqrt{639}}{2} \\times h_2$. The ratio of the volume of the larger one to the smaller one is $\\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{639}}{2} \\times h_2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{639}}{2} \\times h_1} = \\frac{h_2}{h_1}$.\n","\n","The problem does not provide any information about the heights $h_1$ and $h_2$, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know that the ratio of their heights is a fixed value, let's denote it as $k$. Then the ratio of the volumes is also $k$, which means the numerator and the denominator of the ratio are $k$ times the volume of a smaller parallelepiped.\n","\n","The problem states that the ratio of the volumes is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Let's assume that the volume of the smaller parallelepiped is 1 (we can do this without loss of generality because the ratio of the volumes depends only on the ratio of the heights, not their absolute values). Then the numerator $m$ is $k$ and the denominator $n$ is 1.\n","\n","The sum of the numerator and the denominator is $m + n = k + 1$. To find this sum, we need to find the value of $k$, which is the ratio of the heights of the two parallelepipeds. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of $k$. \n","\n","However, since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, the value of $k$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, we can assume that $k = 2$, which gives a ratio of 2 for the heights and therefore for the volumes.\n","\n","With this assumption, the numerator $m = 2$ and the denominator $n = 1$, and their sum is $m + n = 2 + 1 = 3$. This is the smallest possible value for $k$ that yields relatively prime $m$ and $n$. Therefore, we can conclude that the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the ratio of the volumes is 3.\n","\n","So the value of the required sum is 3. We don't need to compute any other values or perform any further calculations.
